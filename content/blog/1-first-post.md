# Welcome to My Blog

This is going to be my thoughts on anything and everything. It's mainly a way of playing with website building.

* 💻 Building websites
* 🖖🏽 Star Trek
* ✈️ Airplanes
* 🧠 Mental Health
* 📰 Politics
* 🎹 Music

I built this website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [View Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API).

This post itself is written in Markdown.

## What I Used to Build This Blog

Here are some of the key ingredients that went into making this blog:

* **Hugo:** The framework powering the whole thing. This is one of several different frameworks I've built this blog in.
* **Markdown:** For writing all the content (like this post!). It's so simple and effective.
* **View Transitions:** To create those smooth animations when you click between pages. It's a really nice touch!
* **Custom Styling:** I've added some personal touches to the design to make it my own.
* **Cursor:** Of course, I vibe coded it... All while learning how to do it more myself.

```js
// A little code snippet to show off code blocks!
const greeting = "Hello, Hugo Blog!";
console.log(greeting);
```
